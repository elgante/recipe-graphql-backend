üõ†Ô∏è Learning GraphQL, Apollo Server, and MongoDB.
This simple project is part of my curious and hands-on journey to have basic understanding 
of how to build a simple backend using GraphQL with Apollo Server and MongoDB.
It includes basic CRUD operations for a recipe management. 
The goal was to understand how to structure a GraphQL schema, connect to a MongoDB database, and use Apollo.
